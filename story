Frankfurt2 
The woman sat in the flughafen eating some brot and bratwurst.
She was enjoying a Kopfkino about her upcoming trip to Berlin.
The klimaanlage quit working, so she went to a biergarten for a drink.
When the Biergarten was full she opted for the Ratskeller instead, right off of Hauptstrasse.
She had a Schnapsidee to hide some more of it in her Dirndel.
Suddenly, she woke up from her kopfkino to the sound of musik.
It was a wettbewerbsfaehig interpretive dance troupe in glittery Lederhosen.
The sound of Schneewittchen ruined her Luftschloss where she had an unlimited supply of Bratwurst.
